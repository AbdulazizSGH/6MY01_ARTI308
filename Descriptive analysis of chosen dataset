Descriptive Analysis:

The dataset contains 5,000 job records with 22 features describing industry, seniority, company size, salary, automation risk, and AI intensity.
It includes both categorical and numerical variables, along with labeled outcomes such as AI job displacement risk (Low/Medium/High) and reskilling requirement, making it suitable for supervised classification analysis.
Overall, the data appears clean with minimal missing values and a balanced structure for machine learning tasks.

Problem statement: This model aims to predict ai job displacement risk based on several job related factors like industry, seniority and automation risk. 

Type: Supervised Classification
Target variable: ai_job_displacement_risk
Expected learning: Learn patterns between job characteristics and AI impact indicators in order to predict the level of AI-related job displacement risk
